# Game-App-Show

In this project I created a functional guessing game, using JavaScript and CSS. On start, the game generates a random phrase, in which the user has to guess all the letters while not losing all of their 'lives'. 'Lives' are lost by selecting a letter which is not contained in the phrase.
For testing purposes, the phrases used are:  
* "Dramanice"
* 'Hangman',
* 'Teamtreehouse',
* 'Mission Impossible',
* 'Ant Man'
