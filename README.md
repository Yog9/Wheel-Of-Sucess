# Wheel Of Sucess
[Demo Wheel Of Sucess Here]( https://yog9.github.io/Wheel-Of-Sucess/)

### Summary
Wheel Of Sucess is a browser version of a word guessing game. I used Javascript to come up with a random phrase that players will try to guess by clicking letters from an onscreen keyboard to try to guess the random phrase.

### Motivation
The purpose of this project was to understand more about Javascript.

### Getting Started
 Click the demo link or clone/download the repository on your local machine and open the index.html file with a browser.
 
 For testing purposes, the phrases that I used are:  
 * someday your prince charming will come.
 * people say nothing is impossible.
 * if you can't beat them arrange to have them beaten.
 * cheer up the worst is yet to come.
 * he who laughs last did not get it.


### How To Play Wheel Of Sucess
1. Click on the start button.
2. Start clicking on the letters to guess the phrase.
3. If you lose click the restart button to play again.
4. User is provided with five lives and the lives are lost by guessing the wrong letter in the phrase.

### Built With
* HTML5 
* CSS3
